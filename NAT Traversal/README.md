# NAT Traversal
This is part of my research done on various networking techniques used in game development. In this project I look at using NAT traversal to allow two peers to connect directly to each other when they are both behind NAT. This is used by programs like Steam to allow friends to play together without going through the trouble of port-forwarding.
